Ruter.no directions map
========

Ruter.no gives you directions from a stop to your destination. The map is only 460px wide, and it is hard to get an overview of where you are.
To make matters worse, right next to the map there are text directions that distracts and are a waste of space (I have never used them), 
I just want my map.

* Install minimalist plugin for chrome (if not already installed)
* Add custom dashboard
* In @includes add: *reiseplanlegger.ruter.no*
* Make a custom rule with ruter.css in the css field
* Save and enable rule
