Pause gifs on woop.im
=======

As some of you may know, we use a new cool message service made by <a href="http://github.com/klette">klette</a>.
On fridays it is sometimes spammed with animated gifs. This is fun, but you don't really want to watch  them loop forever.
Here is a way to pause gifs in chrome.

* Use minimalist plugin
* Add a new dashboard for *woop.im* 
* Add a new rule, and use woop.js in the js field
* Enable and save
* Now you can press escape, and gifs will stop animating
