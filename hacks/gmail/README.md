Add back link to google apps from gmail
======

Gmail used to have a collections of very handy links, so that you were always one click away from other google apps like calendar or docs.
Google removed theese links, and cleaned up the gui, so that all apps are now two clikcks away. I could not live with this, here is how you
change it back.

* Install minimalist plugin
* Add new rule for gmail
* Paste gmail.css and gmail.js to css and js text-boxes
* Enable and save

Only docs (drive) and calendar links are included, it should be quite simple to modify the javascript to get other links as desired.
